= Docker examples

== refstuff contains a working example

refstuff defines two containers, named db and web.
The containers are configured with a docker-compose.yml file

The yml file uses one secret that is taken form the [red]`.env` file
which is NOT present in the repo for obvious reasons.

The .env file should contain one line declaring the PG_PASSWORD key

[source,sh]
----
PG_PASSWORD=changeme
----


DO NOT add/commit this .env file, but rather ignore it in the .gitignore file.

You should of course change the password to a better value that you keep to your selves.
You only need it on your machine.
